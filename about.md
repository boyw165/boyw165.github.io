I'm a programmer who has over 7-years coding experience in a wide range of languages. Love UI, software infrastructure, algorithms, Machine Learning and fun technology.

> Boy is one of the hardest working people I've ever worked with, and smart to boot. When we hired him he had zero JavaScript experience, but he picked it up quickly through hard work and now knows his way around the JS world. Challenges eat away at him, and he won't quit till he's fixed them.
